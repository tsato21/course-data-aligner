        <!-- Brief Project Overview -->
        <h1 id="top" class="mb-4">Course Organization System</h1>
        <p>This comprehensive suite of Google Apps Scripts has been meticulously crafted to automate the standardization and organization of course data within Google Sheets for academic entities. 
           It addresses the common challenge of inconsistent data presentation by individual academic programs, ensuring alignment with centralized database systems. 
           The project comprises a series of specialized scripts, each precisely developed to streamline particular facets of the data management cycle. 
           These include the systematic categorization of course offerings, the synchronization of scheduling data, and the efficient coordination of faculty assignments. 
           The primary objective is to reformulate course-related data to mirror the structured format employed by the institution's database, thereby enhancing administrative efficiency, minimizing the propensity for manual input errors, and ensuring seamless retrieval of well-organized data.
           You can find the sample sheet from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hG3fAQrBgtwIdJQAG5O8JBaQNG7n__tpV4-DVsqZSd0/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.

          <p>This script focuses on structuring course offering data from a provided dataset. It filters and restructures the data into the one consistent with the institution's database, ensuring that course codes, semesters, and faculty details are laid out and ready for analysis.</p>
          <!-- Logic and Usage -->
          <p><strong>Logic:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>The script starts by reading course offering data from the '1_Offering Data by Program' sheet.</li>
              <li>It then filters out specific course codes that are predefined and do not require being displayed. These course codes are defined in the constant variables set before the function (e.g., 'MXD304', 'WNV327').</li>
              <li>The organized data (Course Code, Semester, Faculty) is then displayed on the '1_Organized Offering Data' sheet.</li>
            </ol>

          <p><strong>Usage:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Insert the course offering data, supplied by the target Program, into the orange cells of the '1_Offering Data by Program' sheet.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the '1_Organized Offering Data' sheet and click the designated button.</li>
            <li>Organized course offering data will be automatically displayed in columns A ~ C.</li>

            <li>It checks each cell against a specific pattern (three alphabets followed by three digits). If the cell data matches, the cell data is stored. If it does not match the pattern, it is stored as an exceptional record.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>The script begins by extracting class schedule data from the '2-2_Schedule Data by Program' sheet.</li>
            <li>It then validates each cell's initial element against a specific pattern (three alphabets followed by three digits). If the pattern is not matched, the data is ignored. If it matches, the cell data is parsed into course codes, course titles, and faculties. Any faculty name that matches a pre-defined name in the constant variable is adjusted accordingly.</li>
            <li>Next, the script processes the data, generating multiple records if course codes contain "/" or faculties contain ",". It then groups these records based on course code, day, and faculty.</li>
            <li>Once grouped, the script scrutinizes records with the same day and merges them, except when the class number includes "2" and "3" due to the lunch break in-between. The data is then organized by course code.</li>

          <h2 id="2-3_organize-schedule-data">2-3. Organize Schedule Data (Type 3)</h2>
          <p>This Google Apps Script is designed to reformat class schedule data to match the institution's data management systems. It organizes details such as course codes, titles, faculty names, class days and numbers, and start and end times. This provides a simplified and accessible view for further analysis and reporting.</p>

          <!-- Logic -->
          <p><strong>Logic:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Starts by getting schedule data from '2-3_Schedule Data by Program'.</li>
            <li>Checks each data entry to make sure it's in the right format, specifically three letters followed by three digits for course codes.</li>
            <li>During course record processing, the script checks if the course code includes a slash. If so, it splits the course code and creates two separate records. If the course code is part of a designated category (i.e., EAA course), it retrieves the section code from the second row of the sheet to form the class code. In other cases, it checks if the course code includes a "-", and if not, appends "-1" to form the class code.</li>
            <li>When pushing records, the script checks if the target course is in a category that doesn't require a second record. If so, it creates only one record. If the course cell is located in either Monday & Wednesday range or Tuesday & Thursday range, multiple records are created. If it is located in Friday range, only one record is created.</li>
            <li>Processed data is displayed in columns A ~ G on the '2-3_Organized Schedule Data' sheet. While displaying data, the script validates each item of the course record. If an item is not valid, it highlights the value in red on the display sheet for easy identification.</li>
